 * Memory allocator that pre-allocates memory and recycles it. This wastes
 * memory but reduces the number of page faults. It has a lower bound and an
 * upper bound. Allocations of less than the lower bound, or more than the
 * upper bound, are satisfied directly with @c new. Allocations in between
 * the bounds are satisfied from the pool. If the pool is exhausted, the size
 * is increased. If the free pool grows beyond a given size, memory is returned
 * to the OS.
 *
 * The memory pool must be managed by a std::shared_ptr. The caller may safely
 * drop its references, even if there is still memory that has been allocated
 * and not yet freed.
 *
 * This class is thread-safe.
